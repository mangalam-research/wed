Introduction
============

Wed is a schema-aware editor for XML documents. It runs in a web
browser. The software is at the beta stage. It is being used in a
project for editing scholarly articles. We aim to make it extensible
by means of a stable API, but the API is likely to change quickly for
now.

Wed is tested on Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer.

Our extensive documentation can be `read here
